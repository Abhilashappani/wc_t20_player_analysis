# wc_t20_player_analysis
contains the visual dashboard of players based on the recent tournament they played.
  
The JSON files are initially loaded on to the Jupyter Notebook for the purpose of data transformation and data cleaning.
Then the processed data is converted into CSV files 
CSV files are then loaded in to Microsoft Power BI Desktop for the visualization purpose.
I used certain KPI to analyse and sort the players based on their performance in the series T20 world cup.
